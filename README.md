# AdventureGame
This is a small-mid sized project for school.<br>
This repository contains the Project as well as some additional data.<br>
Additional data includes<br>
Blueprint<br>
  Early version of how the project should look like<br>
    UML, basic class definitions and some use cases<br>
Final <br>
  The final version of the game<br>
  This includes the Final UML as well as two rather large sequenz diagramms.<br>
  
  
How to run?<br>
Works best if you run the game in windows command promt with the Project.jar being in the Project root folder.<br>
java -jar Project.jar
Intellij Also works fine but does not clear the console.<br>


But what excactly is this game?<br>
It is a rouge like dungeon game where you go from room to room and fight enemies.<br>
At the start of the game you will create your character with a name and a class of your choosing!<br>

You will be able to learn powerfull attacks by using skill books.<br>
There is only one way to heal yourself, and that is with potions.<br>

What makes this game stand out is its combat mechanic regarding "Elemental Reactions"<br>
They make you deal more damage, give your enemy a debuff, or heal you.<br>
This is all based on the order of your attacks.<br>
I encourage you to experiment with attack orders.<br>

Note:<br>
The game may not be perfectly balanced.
